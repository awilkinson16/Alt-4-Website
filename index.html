      <h1>Home</h1>

    <h1>Plan 1</h1>
    <p1>My first plan did not go well as the code I would have needed was too advanced. I was trying to use a Python Skype module to control skype using the microbit. I was planning on having a few buttons connect to the microbit that would be able to call specific contacts within skype. This would be to help elderly or anyone who has difficulty managing a computer to help them keep in contact especially during covid. I was able to plan how I was going to use the if statements and the commands from the skype module but I was unable to connect the skype module to python and therfore was unable to connect python to skype.</p1>
    <h1>Plan 2</h1>
    <p1>My second plan went much better. I was able to plan exactly what code I was going to use, which was mostly if statements and variables. I used an if statement that was active and counted the time variable up by one every second if the time variable was less than its designated 3300 seconds which is 55minutes, our lessons our 1 hour long each so 55minutes would give a notification 5 minutes before the end of class. I also had an if statement for whether the student is standing or sitting. Then I used a standing variable for if the student is standing for more than 5 seconds it will reset the time variable, I also made it so that when it is waiting for the go ahead from the standing variable it displays 3 dots and then when they are sitting down it will start counting up to 55 minutes or 3300 seconds. Then if the time variable = the set time (for the demo its 10 seconds) and the student is sitting then it will dislplay a 5 on the screen and buzz the buzzer for a second. I also made it so that when they are either standing or sitting it will show different shapes to show the microbit is working. And finally I have it so that if you press b it will turn off the buzzer just incase.</p1><br>

      <h1>Initial Investigation</h1>
      <p style="color:#FF0000";>The task for your team is to design a product that will implement a microprocessor system that uses sensors and controls digital and analog, inputs and outputs as part of an embedded system. The product will be of value to those with an accessibility problem. This might include people who are elderly, blind, deaf etc. for whom mainstream technology can be challenging.</p>
      <h3>Definitions</h3>
      <p style="color:#FF0000";>Microprocessor</p><p>A microprocessor sytem consists of data input, storage, processing and output devices, under the control of a CPU.</p>
      <p style="color:#FF0000";>Accesssibility Problems</p>
      <p>People with cognitive difficulties, vision impairment or deaf people often have trouble accessing websites</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Sudo_Code" data-tab-content>
      <h1>Sudo Code</h1>
      <p>My project is to alert students five minutes before the end of class, I plan on accomplishing this through a series of variables and if statements. For example I will have an if statement for if they are standing or sitting, an if statement for if the time variable is at 55 minutes, an hour or below that. I will also have some L.E.Ds to show what the code is thinking more visually. If the time variable is at 55 minutes then it will engage a buzzer for 2 seconds or so and then stop.</p>
      <h1>Actual Code</h1>
      <p1>I added in a few extra pause commands to make it all run abit more smoothly and also to allow for the student to move around a little bit. To allow the student to move i added a command so that it only resets the time variable(To reset it for when the student moves class)when the student stands up for more than five seconds</p1>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p1>The code below also has the if statement for controlling the buzzer set to go off after 10 seconds, this is only for demonstration purposes and will actually be set to 3300 Seconds (or 55minutes)</p1>

        <h1>Understanding The Problem</h1>
        <p1>The task is to create something using microbits to aid people who have physcical or mental disabilitys.</p1>
        <h1>Initial Ideas</h1>
        <h4><p style="color:#FF0000";>1. Asking for discreet help in class</h4>
        <p>A child with learning disabilities may find it embarrasing to put their hand up to ask for help, we could use a microbit that they can have on them that when they press a button it will send a message to their teacher or SNA saying that they want help</p>

       <h4><p style="color:#FF0000";>2. Telling time reminder</h4>
        <p>A child that has a learning difficulty may have trouble telling time, we could create a microbit connected to a buzzer that has the students time table coded into it and will buzz to remind the student when to move lessons or when break time is over etc</p>

        <h4><p style="color:#FF0000";>3. Falling dectetor</h4>
        <p>For an elderly person living alone, we could put a microbit on them that will detect when they have fallen over and will alert the emergency services</p>

        <h4><p style="color:#FF0000";>4. Emotion aid</h4>
        <p>People who suffer with autism or other disabilities will sometimes find it hard to recognise emotions, we could have a microbit that can scroll through differnt faces e.g smiley, sad, angry and then once they've found the one that looks right they can click a button to display what the word for that emotion is</p>

        <h4><p style="color:#FF0000";>5. Elderly walking safety aid</h4>
        <p>For an elderly person living alone it is sometimes a daunting or scary task to even go on a walk alone. We could create a microbit that will track them, keep track of the amount of steps and warn them if they are doing too much excersise as elderly people often have weak bodys but sometimes do not realise it. It could also have a sensor that will detect if they have fallen and will send a message to the emergency services along with their location</p>

        <h4><p style="color:#FF0000";>6. Helping elderly keep in touch during the pandemic</h4>
        <p>Many elderly struggle to use smart devices and the internet, if we could have a microbit placed somewhere on the computer that with a simple button press would launch and call family it would be invaluable</p>
    </div>
    <div id="Plan" data-tab-content>
      <h1>Initial Plan</h1>
      <p><strike>One possible idea I could use is number six, the ;'Helping elderly keep in touch' i think it would be relativly easy to do, all we would have to do is connect the microbit to a desktop or laptop and have a simple if button press statement. And if the button was pressed it would load skype or something like that, i was also thinking i could connect it to a breadboard and possibly have like 5 or six buttons that will call different contacts that the user wants. It could then possibly have a buzzer that beeps when ready and a L.E.D to show if the camera is on or off.The code would be fairly advanced to actually run something on the desktop so im not sure if this is actually possible. If it works this could be applied also to people with learning difficulties maybe working from home and finding it hard to work with zoom etc. They could have a button for each of their subjects with maybe a picture beside it with the name of the subject and once the call is made and it is passed the time that lessson is due for we could have a variable that says it is passed and disable that button to make it even simpler</strike></p>

      <p>This code proved to be much more advanced than I had intitially thought, and so I had to change my project.</p>
      <h1>Final Plan</h1>
      <p>I changed my project to number 2, the telling time reminder. This is for a student who has a learning difficulty or a physical difficulty meaning that they need a bit more time to tidy up and get ready at the end of class. I intend to make a microbit that will detect when they sit down for a class and begin counting down from an hour and will alert them 5 minutes before the end of class.</p>

    <div id="Reflection" data-tab-content>
      <h1>Reflection</h1>
      <p1>I have learn't allot from this project and I really enjoyed it. I refreshed my memory about how to code websites, and i got to learn about how to use java script and microbits as well as making circuits in real life with breadboards and buzzers and microbits etc.. I also learn't that code doesnt need to be to complicated to work well, the first project I started working on was much to hard for me but I enjoyed working on the second project just as much even though it was a little bit easier.</p1>
